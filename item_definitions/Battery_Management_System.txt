# Example Item Definition
# Battery Management System

## Item Information
Item Name: Battery Management System
Item ID: BMS-EV-001
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

The Battery Management System (BMS) is responsible for monitoring and controlling
the high-voltage battery pack in electric vehicles to ensure safe and efficient operation.

### Functions:
1. Monitor individual cell voltages continuously
2. Monitor cell and pack temperatures
3. Calculate State of Charge (SoC)
4. Calculate State of Health (SoH)
5. Control main contactors (open/close)
6. Balance cell voltages during charging
7. Communicate battery status via CAN bus
8. Detect and report faults
9. Control cooling system activation
10. Implement safety shutdown procedures

## 2. Interfaces

### Internal Interfaces:
- Cell voltage sensors (up to 96 cells)
- Temperature sensors (12 locations)
- Current sensor (high-precision shunt)
- Main positive and negative contactors
- Cell balancing circuits
- Cooling system controller

### External Interfaces:
- Vehicle Controller (VCU) via CAN bus
- Charger via CAN bus
- Instrument cluster for driver information
- Diagnostic interface (OBD-II)

## 3. Operating Modes

1. **Standby Mode**: System powered, monitoring active, contactors open
2. **Drive Mode**: Contactors closed, full monitoring, power delivery
3. **Charge Mode**: Contactors closed, charge monitoring, balancing active
4. **Sleep Mode**: Low power consumption, periodic wake-up
5. **Fault Mode**: Safe state, contactors open, fault flagged
6. **Service Mode**: For maintenance and diagnostics

## 4. Environmental Conditions

- Operating Temperature: -40째C to +85째C
- Storage Temperature: -40째C to +105째C
- Humidity: Up to 95% RH (non-condensing)
- Vibration: ISO 16750-3 compliant
- EMC: ISO 11452 series compliant

## 5. Safety Requirements (Preliminary)

Safety goals derived from HARA:
- SG1: The BMS shall detect cell overvoltage within 10ms
- SG2: The BMS shall isolate the battery within 50ms upon critical fault detection
- SG3: The BMS shall prevent battery operation outside safe temperature range
- SG4: The BMS shall maintain communication with VCU with <100ms timeout

## 6. Constraints

- Must interface with existing vehicle CAN network
- Limited to 1A maximum current draw for BMS electronics
- Must fit within allocated battery pack space
- Must operate without external cooling for BMS electronics
