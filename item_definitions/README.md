# Item Definitions Folder

Place your Item Definition files here for HARA analysis.

Supported formats:
- .txt
- .md
- .docx (if docx support is installed)

File naming:
- Use descriptive names that match the item name
- Example: "Battery_Management_System.txt"
- Example: "Windscreen_Wiper_System.md"

The HARA Assistant will automatically search this folder when you request:
"extract functions from [item name]"

Alternatively, Item Definitions generated by the ItemDefinition_Developer plugin
will be automatically detected if they are in the working memory or in the
ItemDefinition_Developer plugin folders.
