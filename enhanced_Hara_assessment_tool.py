**S0: No injuries**
- AIS 0 and less than 10% probability of AIS 1-6
- Examples: Minor property damage, bumps with roadside infrastructure, light grazing damage

**S1: Light and moderate injuries**
- More than 10% probability of AIS 1-6 (but not S2 or S3)
- AIS 1: Light injuries (skin wounds, muscle pains, whiplash)
- AIS 2: Moderate injuries (deep flesh wounds, concussion <15min, uncomplicated fractures)
- Examples:
  * Rear/front collision with very low speed
  * Side impact with tree at very low speed
  * Minor pedestrian/bicycle accident

**S2: Severe and life-threatening injuries (survival probable)**
- More than 10% probability of AIS 3-6 (but not S3)
- AIS 3: Severe injuries (skull fractures without brain injury, spinal dislocations below C4 without cord damage)
- AIS 4: Severe life-threatening (concussion up to 12h unconsciousness, paradoxical breathing)
- Examples:
  * Front collision with passenger compartment deformation
  * Side impact with tree at medium speed
  * Rear/front collision at medium speed

**S3: Life-threatening (survival uncertain) or fatal injuries**
- More than 10% probability of AIS 5-6
- AIS 5: Critical injuries (spinal fractures below C4 WITH cord damage, >12h unconsciousness, intracranial bleeding)
- AIS 6: Fatal injuries (cervical fractures above C3 with cord damage, critical open wounds of body cavities)
- Examples:
  * High-speed collisions
  * Rollover accidents
  * Unprotected occupant ejection

**Assessment Approach:**
1. Consider the operational situation (speed, traffic density, vehicle dynamics)
2. Estimate the collision energy/impact forces
3. Consider occupant protection (seatbelts, airbags - assume functioning unless the item affects them)
4. Assess harm to ALL persons at risk: driver, passengers, pedestrians, other vehicles
5. Use the WORST CASE injury among all persons for classification
6. Consider reasonable sequences of events, not extreme outliers

    return """
**ISO 26262-3:2018 Controllability Classification (Table 3 + Annex B.6):**

**C0: Controllable in general**
- >99% of drivers can avoid harm
- Simple, routine driver actions sufficient
- Clear warning with ample time to react (>3s)
- Examples:
  * Distracting events (unexpected radio volume increase)
  * Unavailability of non-critical driver assistance (adaptive cruise control)
  * Unintended window closing (remove arm from window)
  * Loss of propulsion in garage (put car in park)

**C1: Simply controllable**
- >99% of drivers can avoid harm with minor additional effort
- Adequate warning time (1-3s)
- Straightforward corrective action required
- Examples:
  * Unintended closing of window while driving (remove arm)
  * Blocked steering column from standstill (brake to stop vehicle)
  * Inadvertent opening of bus door with passenger standing (passenger grabs handrail)

**C2: Normally controllable**
- 90% to 99% of drivers can avoid harm
- Limited warning time (0.5-1s)
- Requires skilled driver action
- Scenario conditions moderately impair controllability
- Examples:
  * Failure of ABS during emergency braking (maintain intended path)
  * Propulsion failure at high lateral acceleration (maintain path)
  * Excessive trailer swing during braking (counter-steer and brake)

**TEST CRITERION for C2:**
Per ISO 26262 and RESPONSE 3 methodology:
- 20 valid test subjects
- If all 20 pass the scenario, achieves 85% controllability with 95% confidence
- This provides adequate evidence for C2 classification

**C3: Difficult to control or uncontrollable**
- <90% of drivers can avoid harm
- No or very short warning (<0.5s)
- Requires exceptional driver skill
- Scenario conditions severely impair controllability
- Physical limitations prevent effective response
- Examples:
  * Failure of brakes at speed (steer away from objects)
  * Faulty airbag deployment at high speed (maintain path after airbag blocks vision)
  * Functions with high automation where driver not in loop (no attempt to maintain path)
  * Loss of steering control at high speed

**Assessment Considerations:**
1. **Driver Profile:** Average driver with appropriate training and license, in appropriate condition
2. **Warning Time:** How much time does driver have to react?
3. **Required Action Complexity:** Simple vs. complex corrective maneuvers
4. **Scenario Factors:** Speed, visibility, road conditions, traffic density
5. **Available Controls:** What means does driver have to regain control?
6. **Surprise Factor:** Is the hazard expected or completely unexpected?
7. **Multi-Vehicle:** Consider actions of other traffic participants if relevant

**NOTE:** Controllability is assessed for the vehicle WITH the malfunctioning item, assuming other systems function correctly (unless the item affects them).

**Complete Process for Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment**

---

## Step 1: Extract Functions from Item Definition
**Command:** `extract functions from {item_name}`

**What it does:**
- Reads the Item Definition document for your system
- Identifies all primary functions of the item
- Lists functions with descriptions and normal parameters
- Stores functions for HAZOP analysis

**Prerequisites:**
- Item Definition document must exist (generated or uploaded)

**Output:**
- List of all system functions

---

## Step 2: Apply HAZOP Analysis
**Command:** `apply hazop analysis`

**What it does:**
- Takes each function from Step 1
- Systematically applies 11 HAZOP guide words (NO, MORE, LESS, EARLY, LATE, etc.)
- Identifies malfunctioning behaviors
- Describes potential hazardous events
- Assesses preliminary Severity (S0-S3)

**Prerequisites:**
- Step 1 must be completed

**Output:**
- HAZOP table with: Hazard ID, Function, Malfunction, Hazardous Event, Severity Class

---

## Step 3: Assess Exposure for All Hazards
**Command:** `assess exposure for all hazards`

**What it does:**
- For each hazard from Step 2:
  - Selects 2-4 relevant basic operational situations from database
  - Combines them into a specific driving scenario
  - Calculates combined Exposure using MIN rule: E_combined = MIN(E1, E2, E3, ...)
  - Links each hazard to realistic operational context

**Prerequisites:**
- Step 2 must be completed

**Output:**
- Exposure assessment table with: Hazard ID, Selected Scenarios, Combined Driving Scenario, Exposure (E0-E4)

---

## Step 4: Generate Complete HARA Table
**Command:** `generate hara table`

**What it does:**
- Combines data from Steps 2 and 3
- Assesses Controllability (C0-C3) for each hazard considering driving scenario
- Calculates ASIL using ISO 26262 Table 4: ASIL = f(S, E, C)
- Formulates preliminary safety goals
- Defines safe states and FTTI

**Prerequisites:**
- Steps 2 and 3 must be completed

**Output:**
- Complete HARA table with 12 columns: Hazard ID, Function, Malfunction, Hazardous Event, Operational Situation, S, E, C, ASIL, Safety Goal, Safe State, FTTI

---

## Step 5: Derive Detailed Safety Goals
**Command:** `derive detailed safety goals`

**What it does:**
- For each hazard with ASIL A, B, C, or D:
  - Formulates complete ISO 26262-compliant safety goal
  - Defines detailed safe state specification
  - Specifies FTTI with justification
  - Provides verification criteria
  - Documents assumptions

**Prerequisites:**
- Step 4 must be completed

**Output:**
- Detailed safety goals document for all ASIL A/B/C/D hazards

**Item Definition for {item_name}:**
{item_def_content[:5000]}

**CRITICAL TASK:** Extract and list ONLY the **4-5 MOST CRITICAL safety-relevant functions** of the {item_name}.

**Selection Criteria (Prioritize in this order):**

1. **Highest Severity Impact:** Functions whose failure could lead to:
   - Life-threatening consequences (fire, explosion, electric shock, collision)
   - Severe injuries or vehicle loss of control
   - Critical system failures affecting multiple vehicle systems

2. **Direct Safety Control:** Functions that:
   - Directly control safety-critical actuators (contactors, relays, brakes, steering)
   - Prevent hazardous states (overcharge, thermal runaway, overvoltage)
   - Implement emergency shutdown or safe state transitions

3. **Safety-Critical Monitoring:** Functions monitoring parameters where:
   - Out-of-range values directly lead to hazards
   - Real-time detection prevents propagation of faults
   - Examples: cell voltage limits, temperature limits, isolation monitoring

**IMPORTANT Filtering Rules:**
- **Focus ONLY on functions active during normal vehicle operation** (driving, parking, charging)
- **EXCLUDE:** Diagnostic functions, self-tests, calibration modes, service functions, data logging, UI updates
- **Group similar functions:** If multiple functions serve the same safety purpose, merge them into one (e.g., "Monitor cell 1 voltage, Monitor cell 2 voltage" ‚Üí "Monitor battery cell voltages")
- **Omit regulatory compliance functions** unless they directly prevent hazards (e.g., "Comply with EMC standard" ‚Üí exclude)

**LIMIT:** Select EXACTLY 4-5 functions maximum. If there are more candidates, choose those with:
- Highest consequence of failure (S3 > S2 > S1)
- Most direct path from malfunction to hazard
- Least controllability by driver if failed

**Output Format:**
List ONLY 4-5 functions, numbered:
1. [Function Name]: [Brief description - what it does and why it's safety-critical]
2. [Function Name]: [Brief description]
...
(Maximum 5 functions)

**Example for Battery Management System:**
1. Monitor battery cell voltages: Prevents overcharge/over-discharge leading to thermal runaway
2. Control main contactors: Isolates high voltage to prevent electric shock and fire
3. Calculate State of Charge (SoC): Prevents unexpected loss of propulsion
4. Monitor battery temperature: Prevents thermal runaway by detecting overheat conditions
5. Implement emergency shutdown: Transitions to safe state upon critical fault detection

---

## CRITICAL: ISO 26262-3:2018 Classification Criteria

{get_severity_guidance()}

{get_exposure_guidance()}

{get_controllability_guidance()}

---

## Your Assessment Task:

### Step 1: Operational Situation Selection
Select 2-4 relevant basic scenarios from the database that match when/where this hazard occurs.

**Output:**
- Scenario 1: [ID] - [Name] (Base Exposure: [E level])
  Justification: [Why relevant to this hazard]
- Scenario 2: [ID] - [Name] (Base Exposure: [E level])
  Justification: [Why relevant]
(Continue for all selected scenarios)

**Combined Situation:**
- Name: [Descriptive name]
- Combined Exposure Calculation: MIN([E values]) = [Result]
- Rationale: [Why this combination represents when hazard occurs]

---

### Step 2: Severity Assessment (ISO 26262-3 Table 1 + Annex B.2)

**CRITICAL STEPS:**
1. Identify the operational situation context (speed, traffic, vehicle dynamics)
2. Estimate collision type and energy if applicable
3. Consider occupant protection systems (assume functioning unless item affects them)
4. Assess ALL persons at risk: driver, passengers, pedestrians, other vehicles
5. Map to AIS injury scale
6. Select HIGHEST severity among all persons

**Severity: S[0/1/2/3]**

**Detailed Rationale:**
- Operational context: [Speed, traffic density, vehicle state]
- Potential collision scenario: [What type of accident could occur]
- Expected injuries: [AIS classification for each person type]
- Worst case person: [Who faces highest severity]
- Why this S class: [Specific justification with AIS reference]

---

### Step 3: Exposure Assessment (ISO 26262-3 Table 2 + Annex B.3)

**Method Selection:**
- [ ] Duration-based (hazard present throughout condition)
- [ ] Frequency-based (hazard triggered by events)

**Exposure: E[0/1/2/3/4]**

**Detailed Rationale:**
- Combined operational situation: [From Step 1]
- Duration/Frequency estimate: [Percentage of operating time OR times per year]
- Statistical basis: [Why this E class is appropriate]
- Combination rule applied: [If multiple scenarios, show MIN calculation]

---

### Step 4: Controllability Assessment (ISO 26262-3 Table 3 + Annex B.6)

**CRITICAL FACTORS TO ASSESS:**
1. Warning time available: [How much time to react?]
2. Required driver action: [What must driver do?]
3. Action complexity: [Simple routine vs. skilled maneuver]
4. Scenario impairment: [How do conditions affect controllability?]
5. Driver capability: [What % of average drivers can perform this?]

**Controllability: C[0/1/2/3]**

**Detailed Rationale:**
- Warning characteristics: [Time, clarity, type of warning if any]
- Required action: [Specific control inputs needed]
- Typical driver capability: [Estimated % who can avoid harm]
- Scenario factors: [Speed, visibility, road conditions affecting controllability]
- Why this C class: [Justify based on >99%, 90-99%, or <90% capability]

**Statistical Justification:**
[For C2: Could this pass a 20-subject test per RESPONSE 3?]
[For C1: Engineering judgment that >99% can control]
[For C3: Why <90% can control]

---

### Step 5: ASIL Determination (ISO 26262-3 Table 4)

**Input Values:**
- S = S[X] (from Step 2)
- E = E[X] (from Step 3) [NOTE: E4 maps to E3 for ASIL calculation]
- C = C[X] (from Step 4)

**ASIL Calculation:**
Using ISO 26262-3:2018 Table 4:
[Show the table lookup]

**Result: ASIL [QM/A/B/C/D]**

---

### Step 6: Safety Goal Formulation

**Safety Goal:**
[Action verb] [hazardous event description] [during operational context]. (ASIL [X])

**Safe State:**
[Specific system condition ensuring safety - measurable and verifiable]

**FTTI (if applicable):**
[Time in ms/s] OR N/A
**Justification:** [Why this timing based on hazard dynamics]

**Exposure Assessments (with Driving Scenarios and E):**
{exposure_assessments[:5000]}

**CRITICAL TASK:** Generate a complete HARA table with **ALL 12 COLUMNS**. Do not omit any column.

---

## REQUIRED TABLE FORMAT (MANDATORY - ALL 12 COLUMNS):

| Hazard ID | Function | Malfunctioning Behavior | Hazardous Event | Operational Situation | Severity (S) | Exposure (E) | Controllability (C) | ASIL | Safety Goal | Safe State | FTTI |

---

## COLUMN-BY-COLUMN INSTRUCTIONS:

### Columns 1-5: Copy from HAZOP Analysis
- **Hazard ID**: HAZ-001, HAZ-002, etc. (copy exactly)
- **Function**: Copy from HAZOP
- **Malfunctioning Behavior**: Copy from HAZOP
- **Hazardous Event**: Copy from HAZOP
- **Operational Situation**: Copy from Exposure Assessment (driving scenario)

### Column 6: Severity (S) - COPY FROM HAZOP
- **CRITICAL**: Extract S0/S1/S2/S3 from HAZOP table
- **Do NOT calculate** - this was already assessed in Step 2
- **Copy the exact value** (e.g., "S3", "S2")

### Column 7: Exposure (E) - COPY FROM EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT
- Extract E0/E1/E2/E3/E4 from Exposure Assessment table
- Match by Hazard ID
- Note: E4 will map to E3 for ASIL calculation

### Column 8: Controllability (C) - NEW ASSESSMENT
Consider the operational situation (driving scenario) to assess:

- **C0**: >99% controllable (clear warning, simple action, >3s reaction time)
- **C1**: >99% controllable with minor effort (adequate warning, 1-3s reaction time)
- **C2**: >90% controllable (skilled action needed, 0.5-1s reaction time)
- **C3**: <90% controllable (no warning, <0.5s reaction, or physically impossible)

**Context matters:**
- High-speed + adverse weather ‚Üí C3 (difficult to control)
- Low-speed + normal conditions ‚Üí C0 or C1 (easy to control)

### Column 9: ASIL - CALCULATE
Use ISO 26262-3:2018 Table 4:
- Input: S (from HAZOP), E (from Exposure), C (just assessed)
- Output: QM, A, B, C, or D
- Verify calculation is correct

### Column 10: Safety Goal - FORMULATE
**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- ‚úÖ Start with: Avoid, Prevent, Ensure, Maintain, Mitigate, Limit
- ‚ùå DO NOT write: "The [system] shall..." or "System shall..."
- Result-oriented at vehicle level
- Keep concise (one sentence)
- Do NOT include ASIL, Safe State, or FTTI here

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Avoid battery overcharge to prevent thermal runaway during charging"
- ‚úÖ "Prevent unintended airbag deployment during normal driving"
- ‚úÖ "Ensure driver visibility through windscreen in all weather"
- ‚ùå "The BMS shall prevent overcharge..." (WRONG)

### Column 11: Safe State - DEFINE
Specific system condition ensuring safety:
- Measurable and verifiable
- Examples: "Battery isolated from HV bus", "Airbag armed but not deployed", "Vehicle immobilized with parking brake"

### Column 12: FTTI - SPECIFY
Fault-Tolerant Time Interval:
- Format: "50ms", "100ms", "500ms", "1s", "N/A"
- Guidelines:
  * ASIL D + high-speed: 50-200ms
  * ASIL D + low-speed: 100-500ms
  * ASIL C: 100-500ms
  * ASIL B: 500ms-2s or N/A
  * ASIL A/QM: Usually N/A

---

## COMPLETE EXAMPLE (ALL 12 COLUMNS):

| HAZ-001 | Monitor battery cell voltage | No voltage monitoring | Battery overcharge leading to thermal runaway and fire | Fast charging in extreme heat | S3 | E2 | C3 | ASIL D | Avoid battery overcharge to prevent thermal runaway during charging operations | Battery isolated from charger, thermal management active | 100ms |

---

## GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Start with header row** (copy the 12-column format above)
2. **For each hazard** in HAZOP table:
   - Extract columns 1-5 from HAZOP and Exposure tables
   - **COPY Severity (S)** from HAZOP (do not recalculate)
   - **COPY Exposure (E)** from Exposure Assessment
   - **ASSESS Controllability (C)** based on operational situation
   - **CALCULATE ASIL** using S, E, C
   - **FORMULATE Safety Goal** (start with action verb)
   - **DEFINE Safe State** (specific condition)
   - **SPECIFY FTTI** (based on ASIL and dynamics)

3. **Verify each row has exactly 12 columns**

4. **Do NOT omit Severity (S)** - this is critical for ASIL calculation

**Generate the complete 12-column HARA table now:**

**Language Guidelines:**
‚úÖ USE: prevent, avoid, mitigate, ensure, maintain, detect, limit, control
‚ùå AVOID: monitor, measure, use, implement, activate, send, receive

**Example Analysis:**

**Hazardous Event:** "Cell overcharge leading to thermal runaway and fire"

**Poor Safety Goal (too technical):**
‚ùå "The BMS shall monitor cell voltage every 10ms and open the main contactor within 50ms if voltage exceeds 4.25V per cell"

**Good Safety Goal (result-oriented at vehicle level):**
‚úÖ "Avoid unintended wiper stop, avoid cell thermal runaway, avoid unintende acceleration (ASIL D, Safe State: Battery electrically isolated from charger, FTTI: 100ms)"
*Why good: Focuses on preventing the hazard at vehicle level, includes ASIL, safe state, and FTTI*

**More Safety Goal Examples (Correct Format):**

1. "Avoid loss of braking force during highway driving. (ASIL D)"
2. "Prevent steering system lockup during lane changes. (ASIL D)"
3. "Ensure battery isolation in case of internal short circuit. (ASIL D)"
4. "Maintain safe cell voltage range during all charging operations. (ASIL C)"
5. "Limit battery power output to prevent motor overspeed. (ASIL C)"
6. "Avoid unintended airbag deployment during normal driving. (ASIL C)"
7. "Prevent loss of communication between safety-critical ECUs. (ASIL B)"
8. "Ensure wiper activation when requested by driver. (ASIL B)"
9. "Maintain visibility through windscreen during rain. (ASIL B)"

2. DO NOT include "The [system name] shall"
3. Action verbs to use: Avoid, Prevent, Ensure, Maintain, Mitigate, Limit
4. End with ASIL designation in parentheses

**Correct Examples:**

‚úÖ "Prevent unintended vehicle acceleration during highway driving. (ASIL D)"
‚úÖ "Ensure safe battery operation within temperature limits. (ASIL C)"

**WRONG Examples (DO NOT USE):**
‚ùå "The Battery Management System shall prevent battery overcharge..."
‚ùå "The BMS shall avoid thermal runaway..."
‚ùå "System shall ensure visibility..."
‚ùå "The item shall maintain safe operation..."

**Language Guidelines:**
‚úÖ USE: Avoid, Prevent, Ensure, Maintain, Mitigate, Limit (as first word)
‚ùå AVOID: "The [system] shall", "System shall", monitor, measure, implement

**FTTI Guidelines by ASIL:**
- **ASIL D**: 50-200ms for critical hazards (fire, collision, loss of control)
- **ASIL C**: 100-500ms for severe hazards
- **ASIL B**: 500ms-2s or N/A for less time-critical
- **ASIL A**: Often N/A unless timing is critical

**Consider Driving Scenario:** FTTI should reflect dynamics of operational situation:
- High-speed scenarios ‚Üí Shorter FTTI (50-100ms)
- Urban/parking scenarios ‚Üí Longer FTTI (500ms-2s) or N/A
- Charging/stationary ‚Üí Often N/A

## HAZ-003: Battery Thermal Runaway During Fast Charging

**ASIL Level:** D  
**Severity:** S3 | **Exposure:** E2 | **Controllability:** C3

**Operational Situation:**  
Fast charging in extreme heat

**Safety Goal:**  
Avoid battery overcharge or discharge leading to thermal runaway and fire during fast charging operations. (ASIL D)

**Safe State:**  
Battery pack electrically isolated from charging source; charging process terminated; thermal management active; warning signal to driver/operator; vehicle immobilized if necessary.

**Fault-Tolerant Time Interval (FTTI):**  
100ms

**FTTI Justification:**  
Thermal runaway can propagate rapidly once initiated (cell-to-cell within seconds). 100ms allows detection and isolation before irreversible chain reaction begins. Charging station can halt power delivery. Driver may not be present, so automated response is critical.

**Verification Criteria:**  
- Voltage monitoring latency ‚â§ 10ms verified by test bench
- Contactor opening time ‚â§ 30ms verified by hardware test
- End-to-end fault detection to isolation ‚â§ 100ms verified by HILS
- No thermal runaway propagation in abuse testing with single cell triggered

**Assumptions:**  
- Charging station responds to isolation command within 50ms
- Thermal management system operational during charging
- Battery thermal capacity provides ~200ms before uncontrollable propagation
